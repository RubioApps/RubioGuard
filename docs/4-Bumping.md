# The **'touchy'** block

I named this **the touchy block** because this is the part that could be detected by the remote servers.
A proxy server is a machine that works between the client and the server.

For instance, if you want to connect from your PC to github.com via a proxy server, github.com will only see that the proxy connected, but not the client behind the proxy.

If the proxy has somehow intercepted the trafic, it will let a trace on it. If this trace it detected by the remote server and it does not accept it, this could block the connection.

Typically, Cloudfare protection might block the traffic coming from a misconfigured proxy server.

Therefore, if you want your proxy to act as a "man-in-the-middle' (to store the requests and responses into a cache), you would need to proceed by tuning a process which named "Bumping".

## External Generator of certificatesEXTERNAL SSL_CRTD 

This is needed for the bumping. By using this program, Squid will generate a certificate on-the-fly and it will be used for the given connection.
Prior to use it, you have to build a database of certificates.

You can proceed as it follows:

```
sudo /usr/lib/squid/security_file_certgen -c -s /var/lib/squid/ssl_db -M 4MB 
chown -R proxy:proxy /var/lib/squid/ssl_db

```

Afterwards, we can use that dabatase to the described purposes by adding in squid.conf

```
sslcrtd_program /usr/lib/squid/security_file_certgen -d -s /var/lib/squid/ssl_db -M 4MB options=ALL
sslcrtd_children 20 startup=5 idle=1
```


## Bumping

###Â Skip bump

Here I decided to NOT TO BUMP some domains. This is done based on the ACL defined in the files of the subfolder /etc/squid/acl.
As you see, I do not bump some android user agents, some sensitive domains, some media (like videos), etc.

Why? Because it will be blocked or because I do not need it. 

>REMIND:
>The purpose of the bumping is to decrypt the SSL traffic before caching it. Otherwise, it cannot be cached. 
>For instance, if you connect to your bank, you do not need to cache or hide you identify behind a proxy.
>Thefore, the domain of your bank, will be included into the list of excluded domains.


```
ssl_bump splice localhost
ssl_bump splice HOME
ssl_bump splice BUMP_EXCLUDE_ANDROID
ssl_bump splice BUMP_EXCLUDE_DOMAINS
ssl_bump splice BUMP_EXCLUDE_MEDIA
ssl_bump splice BUMP_SKIP_BUMPED
ssl_bump splice TOR
ssl_bump splice XHR
```


### Force Bump

For the rest of the websites or remote connections, I am interested on bumping the connections done with an internet browser.
Therefore, I peek the connection, I do the handshake with the remote server, and then I bump.

Finally, I splice again the rest of the connections.

```
ssl_bump peek BUMP_STEP1
ssl_bump stare BUMP_STEP2
ssl_bump bump BUMP_FORCE_BUMPED
ssl_bump bump BROWSERS
ssl_bump splice all
```

## Spoofing

Spoofing is the term used to describe the process of alter the HTTP headers sent to the remote server.
If you want the remote server does not know about the web page that has sent you to it, you can alter the headers.

>NOTE: 
>This violates the HTTP standard, and it could turn the browing into a very difficult task. 
>This spoofing is usually blocked by cloudflare.com

You can add the following lines to the squid.conf. I do recommend to NOT to delete the forwarders

```
via on
#forwarded_for delete
follow_x_forwarded_for allow localhost
follow_x_forwarded_for allow localnet
follow_x_forwarded_for deny all

#Spoofed headers
request_header_access X-Forwarded-For deny all
reply_header_access X_Forwarded_For deny all

```
