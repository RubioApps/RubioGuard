## Supported Versions

The suggested squid.conf uses some settings that depend on the running Squid version.
In this case, the given configuration perfectly works for v5.7

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 5.7     | :white_check_mark: |
| < 5.7   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The suggested configuration is prepared for a Domestic Local Network, not for a public server.
If there is any vulnerability, please refer to the Third-Party component I mentioned in README.md.

As soon as another stable version of Squid will be available, I'll tune it up and update an adapted version of the squid.conf.
